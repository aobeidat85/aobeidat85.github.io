      <h2>My Story</h2>
      <p>
        I always was passionate about programming and application development. When I was 12, 
        I created my first program and I instantly was hooked. Later, after I came to the United States, 
        I started a farm and quickly realized how much I enjoyed farming. After various instances where 
        I solved farming issues through automation, I discovered that I could integrate my love of farming 
        with my love of programming. Now, I find great satisfaction in creating unique and novel solutions 
        to solve the hardest problems I can come across on my farm.
